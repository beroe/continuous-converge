# continuous-converge
scripts for detecting convergent adaptation of continuous traits

README and test dataset forthcoming as of 20190103.

Some of these scripts (in particular, `pcoc_cont_scenarios` with the `--sim` flag
set) have finicky dependencies and are thus best run in the PCOC Docker container,
in which you will also need to install the `numpy` and `matplotlib` modules.
